# csgo

Simple Dockerfile that bundles [CS:GO Server](https://steamdb.info/app/740/). Images are versioned based on the [history](https://steamdb.info/app/740/history/) of the app on Steam. A [`start.sh`](./csgo/start.sh) script is provided to help get you up and running quickly, otherwise you can call `/csgo/srcds_run` directly.
